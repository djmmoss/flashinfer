KDA (Key-Driven Attention) Kernels - CuTe DSL Implementations
==============================================================

Per-K-dimension gating variant of GDN. Gate g[B,T,HV,K] applied per-lane
instead of GDN's scalar broadcast.

Exported Kernels:
- kda_gated_delta_rule: KDA BF16 hidden state decode kernel (T=1,2,3,4)
- GatedDeltaRuleKernel: Kernel class for advanced usage
- cutedsl_kda_decode: chunk_kda-compatible wrapper
